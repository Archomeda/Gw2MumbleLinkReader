# Gw2MumbleLinkReader
This is a small tool to help people that are developing against the Guild Wars 2 Mumble Link API.
It's a simple Windows Forms application that shows the current Mumble Link state when Guild Wars 2 is running.

Originally written many years ago, then polished and included in my [Gw2Sharp project](https://github.com/Archomeda/Gw2Sharp), and now separated into its own repository.

Because there are no prebuilt binaries, you'll have to compile the project yourself.
You'll need Windows and the [.NET 5 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) (or Visual Studio 2019 (16.8) or later).
